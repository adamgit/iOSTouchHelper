(meta-note, not part of the license, included "for information only": this is the "simple" modern BSD License with one modification that ONLY affects people issuing pull requests to the original repository. The purpose of the additional clause is to ensure all copyrights are held with one named person, which makes it easy for organizations and individuals who have license queries, and/or to enforce the license upon people who attempt to breach the original terms)
